!!! warning "安全 Safety"

    * 營地所在區域是一個安靜和安全的地方。但是周圍有住家，為了保護自己，家人和他人的安全，請不要隨處走動，除非是大部隊一起活動。
    <br>It’s a pretty quiet and safe neighborhood but there are residents near the camp site. To protect ourselves and our loved ones, please don’t go off camp site unless to the beach or drive else where
    * 下午自由活動時間時，請確保你量力而行。打籃球，盡量不要受傷。在海邊玩耍，也不要靠海浪太近。請看好自己的小朋友們。 
    <br>During free time, please make sure you participate at your own risk. For basket ball games, please know your limits. We don’t want injuries. For games at beach, please stay safe from the waves and be sure to keep an eye on your little ones.
    * 如果你的住宿房間沒有衛生間，請盡量在睡覺前解決一下。如果晚上有需要，請到MPR 或者餐廳解手。請盡量有人陪同。
    <br>If you don’t have restroom in your room, you will need to go to MPR or Dining hall for restroom use at night. Please make sure you take care of that prior to getting to bed. If you have to go at night, please make sure there’s someone who goes with you.
